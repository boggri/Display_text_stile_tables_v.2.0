# Display_text_stile_tables_v.2.0
This is my implementstion of the program that outputs text in defined set of symbols.

# INSTRUCTION. 
Just type the name oh ```.txt``` file that you want to use as symbol table. 
Then type our text and enjoy! 

P.S.
Program doesn't recognize any other symbols except alphabetical (instead it types "?").

# You are able to create your own symbols table. 
1) You must to define length of your simbols in txt file (dont forget to include right-side whitespaces) 
  a) First number - length; then new line;
  b) Second number - hight; then new line;
  > Example of .txt file 
  ```
  4 
  5
  ...your simbols...
  ```
2) Create your own table of simbols: 26 simbols ```A-Z``` + plus ```'?'``` and white space ```' '``` at the end. So totaly we hawe 28 symbols.
